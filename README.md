# 3D Artery Visualization

3D Artery visualization project was developed as a tool to compare 3D represenation and the novel 2D [CerebroVis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12663.pdf) representation.

3D Artery Visualization is built using [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Related Github Repos

This project was built in conjuction with our main project CerebroVis. 

## How to Use With Your Own Data

To use 3D Artery Visualization, you will need the topology and anatomical properties cerebral arteries as a swc file. In this application, we have included, segemented scans from a public dataset. You can learn more about the segmentation process and access the public dataset on the [Brava](http://cng.gmu.edu/brava/home.php?s=1&name_browser=false) project website.

## Dataset Included
After you clone the repo, you can also locally use the dataset we have included in the repo.

path: data -> allscans -> `<foldername>` ->`<filename>`records.swc
